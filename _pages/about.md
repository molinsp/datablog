I'm an inventor with broad experience and skills around product innovation and data analytics. Some of the things I have done: Patented an innovative ski-touring system in college, published research in robotics, developed autonomous drone swarms, worked in a social-enterprise startup in Zambia, consulted with a large-scale government project in Rwanda, advised C-level executives on digital transformation and led product teams for one of the largest international education non-profits and the leading artificial-intelligence startup in the tanker shipping market.
